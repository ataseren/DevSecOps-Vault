# What is DevSecOps

![Gartner DevSecOps Lifecycle](../imgs/gartner.png)

DevSecOps is an approach to software development that integrates security into the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC). It combines the principles of DevOps with security to create a culture where security is everyone's responsibility ‚Äî from developers to operations teams.

## ‚úÖ Why DevSecOps?

- **Security from the Start**: Security is built into the pipeline from the first line of code, not tacked on at the end.
- **Collaboration**: Developers, security professionals, and operations teams work together to automate and embed security throughout the SDLC.
- **Automation & Monitoring**: Security checks (e.g., scanning, testing, compliance) are automated and monitored continuously.
- **Faster Delivery**: Security integration accelerates delivery by reducing late-stage security bottlenecks.

## üîê Key Practices in DevSecOps

1. **Secure Design**: Threat modeling and secure architecture from the early stages.
2. **Secure Coding**: Adherence to language-specific secure coding standards.
3. **Security Testing**: Automated SAST, DAST, SCA integrated in CI/CD.
4. **Secrets Management**: Proper handling of API keys, credentials, and sensitive config data.
5. **Monitoring and Response**: Real-time monitoring of applications and infrastructure for threats.
6. **Compliance and Governance**: Automating checks for security policies and regulations.
