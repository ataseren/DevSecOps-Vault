# 🧪 DevSecOps Labs & Hands-on Platforms

DevSecOps is best learned through practice. These labs and training platforms allow you to build, break, and secure applications and infrastructure in simulated or real environments.

They cover key areas such as:

- Secure coding practices
- Threat modeling
- Vulnerability scanning
- Monitoring & logging
- Container and cloud security
- Infrastructure as Code testing
