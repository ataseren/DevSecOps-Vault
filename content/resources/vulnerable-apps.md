# üí• Vulnerable Applications for DevSecOps Practice

Vulnerable applications are intentionally insecure systems built for learning. They‚Äôre essential for DevSecOps teams to test scanners, perform code analysis, validate threat models, and train developers and security engineers.

These apps simulate common web, cloud, mobile, and serverless vulnerabilities ‚Äî including the OWASP Top 10.

## üß™ How to Use These Apps

1. **Test SAST, DAST, and SCA tools** (e.g., Semgrep, Nuclei, OWASP ZAP) against these apps
2. Use them as targets in **CI/CD security pipelines** (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins)
3. Perform **manual testing and fuzzing**
4. Practice **threat modeling**, identify flaws, and implement remediations
5. Train developers with hands-on **secure coding walkthroughs**
