# üõ° Policy as Code (PaC) in DevSecOps

Policy as Code (PaC) is the practice of defining security, compliance, and infrastructure rules in a programmable format. Rather than relying on manual reviews or documentation, policies are **version-controlled, testable, and enforced automatically**.

PaC allows organizations to enforce:

- Security guardrails (e.g., block open S3 buckets)
- Compliance standards (e.g., CIS, NIST, PCI)
- Operational controls (e.g., resource quotas, naming conventions)

By treating policies like software, DevSecOps teams gain consistency, visibility, and scalability across cloud and infrastructure environments.

## üéØ Why Policy as Code?

- **Automated enforcement** reduces human error
- Policies can be tested, reviewed, and versioned like code
- Brings **security and compliance into CI/CD pipelines**
- Enables **continuous governance** in Kubernetes and cloud
- Encourages **self-service infrastructure with guardrails**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Best Practices

1. **Write policies in code, not documents** ‚Äî integrate into CI/CD pipelines
2. **Use fail-closed patterns** ‚Äî block insecure resources unless explicitly whitelisted
3. **Version and test your policies** like application code
4. **Align PaC with compliance frameworks** (e.g., CIS Benchmarks, NIST 800-53)
5. **Tag violations with metadata** for traceability and reporting
6. **Promote policy-as-self-service** ‚Äî let devs test and validate policies locally
7. **Use different engines where appropriate** (OPA for APIs, Kyverno for K8s, cf-guard for CloudFormation)
