# ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Security in DevSecOps

In DevSecOps, securing cloud infrastructure is just as critical as securing application code. With the rise of Infrastructure as Code and automated CI/CD, cloud environments can change rapidly ‚Äî and security needs to keep up.

Misconfigured services, overly permissive IAM roles, exposed S3 buckets, and untagged resources are among the **most common sources of cloud breaches**. The tools below help identify, remediate, and enforce secure cloud posture across AWS, GCP, and Azure.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Best Practices for Cloud Security

1. Continuously scan for **resource misconfigurations** and open attack surfaces
2. Enforce **least privilege IAM policies** with tools like `policy_sentry`, `AirIAM`
3. **Tag all resources** for accountability and visibility (automate with Yor)
4. Monitor **configuration drift** using real-time frameworks (e.g., ElectricEye)
5. Enable **cross-account and multi-region visibility**
6. Integrate **compliance scans** into CI/CD and infrastructure provisioning steps
