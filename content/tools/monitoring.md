# Monitoring and Observability in DevSecOps

Monitoring plays a critical role in DevSecOps by providing visibility into systems, workloads, and pipelines — allowing teams to **detect anomalies, enforce policies, and respond to incidents in real time**.

While traditional DevOps observability tools focus on performance, DevSecOps expands this to include:

- Runtime anomaly detection (e.g., unexpected syscalls, file access)
- Network traffic analysis
- Log monitoring for security signals
- Alerting on policy violations or suspicious behavior
- Forensics and post-incident analysis


##  Why Monitoring Matters in DevSecOps

- Helps detect security issues **after deployment**, when static/dynamic testing may no longer apply
- Enables real-time response to intrusion attempts or configuration drifts
- Supports compliance requirements via logging and alerting
- Provides **forensic data** for incident response and auditing

##  Common Security Metrics to Monitor

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Authentication** | Failed logins, suspicious IPs, login attempts from new geographies |
| **Authorization** | Privilege escalations, RBAC changes, permission grants |
| **Runtime Behavior** | Shell spawns in containers, binary execution, network connections |
| **Network Flow** | Unexpected east-west traffic, excessive egress, non-whitelisted destinations |
| **CI/CD Pipelines** | Skipped tests, failed security gates, unsigned artifact deployments |
| **Secrets Access** | Access to vault, environment variable changes, AWS token usage |
| **File Integrity** | Changes in binaries, unexpected writes in /etc, log tampering |


## ️ Best Practices

1. **Define SLAs for security metrics** just like performance metrics.
2. **Centralize logs** from cloud, Kubernetes, CI, applications — normalize them for correlation.
3. **Alert only on meaningful thresholds** to reduce noise.
4. **Correlate across sources** (e.g., login → container exec → outbound traffic).
5. **Use dashboards for traceability** during post-incident reviews.
6. **Tag events with metadata** (commit ID, container hash, user) for forensic clarity.
7. **Store logs securely and immutably**, especially for compliance environments.
