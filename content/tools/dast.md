# Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)

Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) is a black-box testing technique that analyzes running applications by simulating real-world attacks. Unlike SAST, which inspects source code without execution, DAST interacts with live instances of the application (typically through HTTP) to discover vulnerabilities like:

- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- SQL Injection (SQLi)
- Command injection
- Security misconfigurations
- Broken authentication
- Sensitive data exposure

DAST tools are ideal for identifying vulnerabilities that arise from configuration issues, runtime behavior, or security flaws that only become apparent during execution.


## Why DAST is Critical

- **Covers runtime vulnerabilities** that static tools may miss
- **Simulates real attacker behavior** in QA/staging/production environments
- **Works language-agnostically** — applicable to any web application regardless of the stack
- **Detects misconfigurations** such as open directories, missing headers, or dangerous endpoints
- **Complements SAST/SCA** for full-stack security coverage

## Common DAST Tools

| **OSS-Fuzz** | [GitHub](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz) | Continuous fuzzing platform by Google to find memory and logic bugs in C/C++/Rust apps. Ideal for libraries and backend services. | ![OSS-Fuzz](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/google/oss-fuzz?style=for-the-badge) |
| **Nikto** | [GitHub](https://github.com/sullo/nikto) | Web server vulnerability scanner that detects outdated components, dangerous files, and security headers. | ![Nikto](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/sullo/nikto?style=for-the-badge) |
| **Skipfish** | [Archived](https://code.google.com/archive/p/skipfish/) | Fast web app security recon tool from Google. Useful for brute-force fuzzing and link crawling. | ![Skipfish](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/spinkham/skipfish?style=for-the-badge) |


## ️Best Practices for DAST in DevSecOps

1. **Run in staging or test environments**  
   Since DAST tools actively probe endpoints, it’s best to scan non-production instances unless the tool is explicitly configured to be safe.

2. **Automate in CI/CD pipelines**  
   Tools like **OWASP ZAP**, **Wapiti**, or **Nuclei** offer Docker support and CLI modes, making them ideal for GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins pipelines.

3. **Combine template-driven and active scanning**  
   Use `Nuclei` for rule-based scans and `ZAP` for full interaction-based analysis — this covers both depth and breadth.

4. **Tune scanners**  
   Disable intrusive or long-running tests for lightweight builds; run full scans nightly or in dedicated security testing stages.

5. **Integrate with bug trackers**  
   Automatically push findings to issue trackers (e.g., Jira, GitHub Issues) with tools like ZAP’s API or custom scripts.

6. **Baseline and suppress false positives**  
   DAST tools often produce noise — invest time in tuning your rules and maintaining suppression lists for known-safe behavior.
