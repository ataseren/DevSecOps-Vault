# Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) allows teams to automate cloud infrastructure through declarative configuration files (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation, Kubernetes YAMLs). While this improves efficiency and reproducibility, it also introduces **risk**:

- Misconfigured storage buckets
- Publicly exposed cloud services
- Overprivileged IAM roles
- Insecure default settings
- Secrets hardcoded into configuration files

**IaC Security tools help shift security left** by scanning code before it’s deployed.

## Why IaC Security Matters

- IaC defines **production infrastructure** — one typo can lead to breaches
- Cloud-native breaches often stem from misconfiguration, not software bugs
- IaC files are version-controlled — scanning them fits naturally into CI/CD
- Automated scanning ensures consistent policy enforcement across environments

## ️Best Practices for IaC Security

1. **Integrate IaC scanning into CI/CD** (pre-commit hooks, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.)
2. **Define organizational policies as code** (e.g., block exposed ports or wildcard IAM roles)
3. **Avoid hardcoding secrets** — use dynamic secret injection or encrypted references (Vault, SOPS)
4. **Use rule suppression intentionally** — track suppressions in version control
5. **Continuously monitor drift** — use tools like Terraform Cloud, `infracost`, or cloud-native config scanners
6. **Scan all IaC types** — including Terraform, Helm charts, Dockerfiles, K8s YAML, and CDK
7. **Standardize baseline templates** to prevent repeated mistakes across teams
