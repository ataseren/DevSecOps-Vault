# üß© Orchestration and Automation in DevSecOps

DevSecOps is not just about integrating security tools ‚Äî it's also about automating and orchestrating how those tools interact. Orchestration platforms provide the **glue** that connects scanning tools, alerting systems, reporting dashboards, and response workflows.

While many orchestration tools are not security-specific, they are often **core to automating security tasks**, including:

- Triggering vulnerability scans post-commit or post-deploy
- Managing incident response flows
- Automating policy enforcement
- Aggregating alerts and analysis across systems
- Reducing manual intervention for repetitive security tasks

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Why Orchestration Matters

- DevSecOps pipelines can involve dozens of tools ‚Äî orchestration helps them work together
- Manual security workflows are slow and error-prone
- Automated response and reporting reduce MTTR and increase visibility
- Reproducible pipelines improve trust and auditability

## üß∞ Orchestration & Automation Tools

| Name | URL | Description | Stars |
|------|-----|-------------|:-----:|
| **StackStorm** | [GitHub](https://github.com/StackStorm/st2) | Event-driven automation platform. Ideal for SecOps, integrates with tools like ZAP, Ansible, Slack, Git, etc. | ![Stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/StackStorm/st2?style=for-the-badge) |
| **Camunda** | [GitHub](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-platform) | Workflow and decision automation engine. Often used for BPM (Business Process Modeling), but powerful for defining security flows as code. | ![Stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/camunda/camunda-bpm-platform?style=for-the-badge) |
| **DefectDojo** | [GitHub](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo) | A vulnerability management and orchestration platform. Consolidates scan results, manages findings, tracks remediation. | ![Stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo?style=for-the-badge) |
| **Faraday** | [GitHub](https://github.com/infobyte/faraday) | Collaborative vulnerability management platform with plugin-based orchestration and reporting support. Great for red and blue teams. | ![Stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/infobyte/faraday?style=for-the-badge) |

## üí° Example Use Cases

- After a CI build passes, automatically:
  - Trigger SAST & DAST scans
  - Aggregate results in DefectDojo
  - Send alerts to Slack/MS Teams if critical issues found
  - Generate a compliance report and update a dashboard

- When a new CVE is released:
  - Cross-check affected dependencies across repos using DependencyTrack
  - Create JIRA tickets for vulnerable components
  - Notify code owners based on ownership metadata

- If a container is flagged by Trivy:
  - Pause the deployment
  - Trigger a security review workflow in Camunda
  - Resume pipeline only if approved

## ‚öôÔ∏è Best Practices

1. **Keep workflows modular**  
   Use small, reusable stages that can be plugged into different pipelines.

2. **Use secure triggers and authenticated event sources**  
   Validate that webhook events (e.g., from GitHub, Jenkins) are legitimate and authorized.

3. **Integrate results across tools**  
   Centralize findings from scanners, linters, and policy engines using platforms like DefectDojo.

4. **Audit workflow executions**  
   Maintain logs for workflow automation runs ‚Äî especially if they touch secrets or trigger deployments.

5. **Automate responses to low-hanging issues**  
   Auto-fix dependency versions, reject vulnerable builds, or send reminders without human intervention.
