##  Philosophy

DevSecOps isn't a tool — it's a **mindset and cultural shift**. It empowers teams to take ownership of security from the first line of code to deployment, monitoring, and beyond.

By breaking this repository into modular files under the `content/` directory, we aim to make the resource:
- **Scalable** as the ecosystem grows
- **Maintainable** by contributors
- **Navigable** for learners and professionals alike
